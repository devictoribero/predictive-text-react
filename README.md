##SETUP
I have used the client `creat-react-app` that has the version to use `Typescript`.
* NPM
* Webpack
* Javascript/ES6
* ReactJS
* Typescript

## How to use it
To use the project run `npm run start`. It will run the project and activate the watch mode.

PS: I haven't use tests because I had a lot of issues with Typescript.

## Summary
Looks like the community have the same problem too.

There is something wrong with Typescript and Jest
